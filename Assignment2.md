##Evaluation of Open Source Projects
######By: Zafar Siddiqui

####Robocode

Robocode is an open source initiative that was started to help students learn java in an engaging and enjoyable way. Robocode is a game where the users must use their skills in java to build a class that codes for a robot that will engage other robots in battle. Robocode has a great system in place for people wanting to learn how to use the software or use their open source platform to develop the game further or change it for their own uses. The RoboWiki, which is their wiki page that is the hub for all of the information for users and developers, is very extensive. It includes several examples of successful robots of the past and guides to get started as a Robocode user. The user interest in this program is great because several teachers at universities or other agencies that are trying to educate students on programming find this as a very engaging tool. There are competitions that use this to encourage people to learn and improve the fundamentals of programming including international competitions such as virtual combat held by Code Fest. 

The documentation for this program is also very extensive. The README file is very detailed providing a great overview of the Robocode project. The documentation section in the wiki page includes sections on a wide variety of very relevant topics, from the physics that is behind the game to what scoring system Robocode uses in their battles. Additionally, there is a very useful developer’s guide for building Robocode. One very important software engineering practice Robocode applies is unit testing, where developers can test individual units of source code as they develop them. For communication purposes, the developers mainly use a google group they have created for this purpose. This group is fairly active with sporadic postings. However, whenever there is a useful posting, the lead developers respond within a few days at most. This ensures that the interest in the particular feature being developed stays high and work on this is efficient. The code itself, however, is very complicated and most of the bugs are fixed by the lead developers themselves. Fixing bugs and actually maintaining the code requires a very deep understanding of Robocode, and developers find more opportunities in adding new features to the user interface and improving documentation. 

There are several areas that still need development in Robocode. One important one, where other developers have shown some interest is creating a good web application that will appeal to the absolute beginners. Beginners would be attracted by an interface that allows, for example, drag and drop commands to begin creating a class (somewhat like the MIT Scratch application for teaching programming logic). Another opportunity for development would be to improve the in-program java editor that is used. It would help to add certain functionalities such as “find and replace” and other features to make it more like other more developed IDE’s such as Eclipse, NetBeans, and BlueJay. 


####Tox

Tox is an open source initiative to create an alternative communications system that is secure. It is being developed on the premise that communications should be as private as possible. This project is still in development phase but there is already a lot of developer/user interest, as well a great framework for developers to use. The user interest is great because it was originally started as a response to the global surveillance disclosures and leaks of the U.S. government. Additionally, this client would support messaging, group messaging, voice and video calling, and several more features that make up the most prevalent systems today like Skype and Google Talk. 

For developers, Tox provides a very user-friendly framework with a lot of relevant information. The documentation includes the coding style that Tox developers should use when creating and naming functions, and how several of the features of the program have already been implemented by developers. They also have a few IRC channels so developers can be updated on developments and discuss possible solutions and improvements with their peers. Overall, the community is very active, especially since the project is in an active development stage. The code itself is predictably quite complex, as there are several smaller projects within this one big open source initiative. However, maintenance of the code is easy because of the organization of the source code in the repository, and the developer tools and forums. There is an active community reporting bugs and attempting to fix them on a daily basis. In general, this project employs great software engineering practices with great communication and elaborate testing systems in place. 

The possibilities of contribution to this project are almost endless, as it has not even been completed yet. There are several bugs to fix and pieces of software to code. In order to make this development process smooth, there is a “Todo” section in both the Github repository and the wiki. There is a lot of graphic interface development to be done. An official GUI has not even been chosen yet, so this shows there is a lot of room for development. Additionally some protocols, such as an offline messaging protocol, have not been developed yet. Some of the documentation is also outdated, and these pages have been labeled. It is important that contributors research the project and update these pages accordingly so that there is no miscommunication between developers, and work remains efficient. 

####Hedgewars

Hedgewars is a turn-based strategy game that is also open-source. There is a lot of user interest because it is an improved version of several previous turn-based fighting games. In Hedgewars, each user controls a team of hedgehogs. Their main website is up to date and there are postings on progress and news around every month. There are YouTube videos with several thousand views on gameplay for this particular game, showing that the user interest is high for this project. 

The documentation for Hedgewars is fairly extensive, but there is room for improvement.  The framework is not very easy to read, and there is no clustering of similar topics for the documentation. Not only is this not very appealing to the developers, but it also is an inefficient method to search for topics. With that said, Hedgewars has a very extensive framework in place to give developers an idea of where there is room for improvement in their program. They also have an IRC for interested developers, but in general, the support systems are not very active at all. The Todo portion of the project on Google Code, for example, has not been updated since December 9th, 2013. The code is simple and seems to be easy to maintain because it is organized well in the repositories. Additionally, it seems like there was once a lot of developer interest, but that has decreased especially in the last few months. 

A lot of work can be done on this project, ranging from very simple to very complex. The GUI needs to be updated in several areas, including increasing the functionality of the chatrooms to include features such as private chats. The documentation needs a lot of improvement as well, and most of the developer resources need to be updated. Additionally, there is a lot of room for improvement in the user interfaces and implementation of this project in both the iOS and Android platforms.
